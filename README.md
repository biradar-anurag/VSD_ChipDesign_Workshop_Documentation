<br>
Arduino Leonardo is a common example of electronics board. It is based on ATmega32u4 chip, and for which we are intrested about. 
<br><br>
Basic fundamental terminologies:
<br><br>
<b>Package:</b>
It is a housing in which ICs are placed. Ex: QFN48 (i.e., Quad Flat No-Lead Package with 48 leads) is one of kind of package in market.
<br><br>
<b>Wire bonds:</b>
It is an electrical interconnection between pins and chip.  
<br><br>
<b>Pads:</b>
